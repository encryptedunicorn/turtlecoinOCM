## What this program does
The Turtlecoin One Click Miner is a GUI for the cryptonight mining software `xmrig` by @psychocrypt `xmr-stak` by @fireice-uk specifically designed to work with TurtleCoin (TRTL) pools. 

## Features
* Mine to your personal address!
* Automatic selection of pools according to their ping, payout threshold and more parameters
* Integrated pool statistics (partly implemented)
* Show stats at specified refresh rate
* Specify usage of CPU/GPU
* Some advanced settings

## Planned features/steps
* ~~Integrate pool statistics~~ done
* ~~Select multiple pools under additional consideration of e.g. pool hashrate~~ done
* Implement/enable all available advanced options for xmr-stak
* Clean up the code and use best practices
* Support Linux :)

## How to build
Download the repository and extract it. Open the .sln file with a recent version of Visual Studio (Community Edition / make sure you have C# packages installed). Build the project using the green run button or "Build Solution" in the Build menu. You'll find the binaries inside the project folder in the directory `bin/debug/` or `bin/release/`. Copy `trtlOCM.exe` to your preferred directory and make sure to have the miner executables in the same folder as described below.

## Important
* Mine at your own risk concerning your hardware
* Refer to [xmr-stak](https://github.com/fireice-uk/xmr-stak) and [xmrig](https://github.com/xmrig)
* The program needs a specific folder structure to work. Upcoming releases wil have it bundled with the miners.

Folder structure from where the OCM is placed:

* miners
  * xmrig
    * xmrig.exe
  * xmrigamd
    * xmrig-amd.exe
  * xmrignvidia
    * xmrig-nvidia.exe
  * xmr-stak
    * xmr-stak.exe *(alongside all other necessary files)*
